My ~~current~~ mobile app project while learning Angular and the Ionic 2 framework.  ~~NOT YET COMPLETE.~~ <br /> 

Update 1 - Added camera feature using [Ionic 2 documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/camera/).

Update 2 - Added Instagram share.  I'm planning to add share to different social media platforms later.  [Documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/social-sharing/)

Update 3 - Figured out how to add different social share buttons -- Instagram, WhatsApp, or user share preference.

Update 4 - Added AdMob banner and interstitial on the app.  The banner won't be intrusive to the user since it's on bottom center
           and interstitial only shows when user checks the "about developer page".

Update 5 - Now available on Android's [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nerdetitan.motivateme).  ~~~Coming 
           soon for iOS AppStore.~~~ And now also on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motivate-you/id1249320215?ls=1&mt=8) 

## How to use this template

```bash
$ ionic serve 
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
