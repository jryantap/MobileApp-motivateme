My current mobile app project while learning Angular and the Ionic 2 framework.  NOT YET COMPLETE. <br /> 

Update 1 - Added camera feature using [Ionic 2 documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/camera/).

Update 2 - Added Instagram share.  I'm planning to add share to different social media platforms later.  [Documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/social-sharing/)

Update 3 - Figured out how to add different social share buttons -- Instagram, WhatsApp, or user preference.

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. The shared files for each starter are found in the [ionic2-app-base repo](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:

Take the name after `ionic2-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myBlank blank
```

Then, to run it, cd into `myBlank` and run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
