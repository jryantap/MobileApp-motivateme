My current mobile app project while learning Angular and the Ionic 2 framework.  NOT COMPLETE. <br /> 
<br />
Update 1 - Added camera feature using [Ionic 2 documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/camera/).
<br />
Update 2 - Added Instagram share.  I'm planning to add share to different social media platforms later.  [Documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/social-sharing/) <br />
<br />
Update 3 - Figured out how to add different social share buttons -- Instragram, WhatsApp, or user preference. <br />
