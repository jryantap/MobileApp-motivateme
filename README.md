My mobile app project.  I'm applying what I'm learning with Ionic 2 framework.  ~~NOT YET COMPLETE.~~ Maybe complete(?) :) <br /> 

---

Now on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nerdetitan.motivateme).
  ~~~Coming soon for iOS AppStore.~~~ And [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motivate-you/id1249320215?ls=1&mt=8)

---

Update 1 - Added camera feature using [Ionic 2 documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/camera/).

Update 2 - Added Instagram share.  I'm planning to add share to different social media platforms later.  [Documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/social-sharing/)

Update 3 - Figured out how to add different social share buttons -- Instagram, WhatsApp, or user share preference.

Update 4 - Added AdMob banner and interstitial on the app.  The banner won't be intrusive to the user since it's on bottom center
           and interstitial only shows when user checks the "about developer page".

Update 5 - Published on mobile. 

Update 6 - Added a user share thoughts page using Firebase. ~~(update not live/published yet)~~. Also added a live quotes page that let me push a new quote to the app so user can see it ~~(not live yet)~~.

Update 7 - Using Reddit's API, added a Reddit page.

## How to use this template

```bash
$ ionic serve 
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
